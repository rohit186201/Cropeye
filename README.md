# Cropeye
Developing an advanced
deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for Drone Precision Farming. Leveraging
TensorFlow and Keras libraries, the model effectively analyzes crop images captured by drones to detect plant
diseases. Employing data augmentation and image preprocessing techniques, Cropeye achieves superior
accuracy and robustness across various crops and environmental conditions.
